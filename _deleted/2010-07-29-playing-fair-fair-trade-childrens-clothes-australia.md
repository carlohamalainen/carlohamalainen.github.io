I am pleased to announce the opening of [Playing Fair](http://playingfair.com.au/), my partner's Brisbane-based online store for fair trade children's clothes. All of the garments are sourced through an importer recognised by the British Association of Fair Trade Shops (BAFTS).

Here's a small sample of the products that are available:</p>

[Playing Fair](http://playingfair.com.au/) was developed using 100% open source software, including [Python](http://python.org), [Satchmo](http://satchmoproject.com), and runs on an [Ubuntu Linux](http://ubuntu.com) server.
