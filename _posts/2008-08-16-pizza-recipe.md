My pizza dough recipe is based on a recipe that I found on foodtv.ca called "Backyard Pizza Dough". I can't find a link to the original page. The original recipe called for 1 tbsp of salt which I believe to be far too much, I only use 1 tsp. 

The ingredients:

  * 2 1/2 cup all purpose flour
  * 1 1/2 tbsp dry active yeast
  * 1 tbsp granulated sugar
  * 1 cup warm water
  * 1 tbsp milk
  * 1 tsp salt
  * flour, for dusting
  * olive oil

In a large bowl mix together the water, yeast, sugar, and milk. Leave it for 5-10 minutes until the yeast starts to make things foamy.

Slowly mix in the flour using a wooden spoon. Don't try to get the whole 2.5 cups in! Keep going until you have a fairly wet dough, then transfer to a lightly dusted surface and knead for a few minutes. The dough will be rather tricky to work with.

Cover with gladwrap and let rise until double in size. Punch down, cover, and leave to rise again.

Preheat oven to 200C.

Prepare toppings. Lightly oil a baking tray and dust with flour.

Pop the pizza in and immediately turn the oven down to 180C.

Cook until the base is just slightly golden.

An example:
