Update (2009-04-23): after a reboot my WL-500gP no longer booted Debian. Nothing appeared in the logs, so it really had me stumped. I ended up installing DD-WRT and all is well.

Here are my notes for installing Debian on an Asus WL-500gP (Premium v1). I basically followed [this guide](http://wpkg.org/Running_Debian_on_ASUS_WL-500G_deluxe). I'm using the WL-500gP as a PC, not a router, so I have no information here about how to configure the VLAN stuff using robocfg.

**Flash the kernel image**

Install tftp on your PC, download the kernel openwrt-brcm47xx-2.6-jffs2-128k.trx and Debian image debian-mipsel-2007-Apr-17.tar.bz2 from [here](http://wpkg.org/Running_Debian_on_ASUS_WL-500G_deluxe:Downloads) (or try my [local copy](http://carlo-hamalainen.net/debian-asus-WL-500gP/) but be sure to check the md5sums).

Set your PC to static IP 192.168.1.3 with gateway 192.168.1.1

Turn off the router. Hold down the "restore" button on the back, and turn on the power. Hold the button until the power LED on the front of the router flashes slowly.

The router is now in diag mode. Upload the image:

    $ tftp 192.168.1.1

    tftp> binary

    tftp> trace

    Packet tracing on.

    tftp> put openwrt-brcm-2.6-jffs2-128k.trx

**Prepare your USB disk on your PC**

I assume that your USB disk is ``/dev/sda`` but it's likely to be something else, so adjust accordingly. Partition your USB disk so that ``/dev/sda1`` is ext3, ``/dev/sda2`` is swap. It is **essential** to make sure that the USB drive is not checked by e2fsck:

    $ tune2fs -c0 -i0 /dev/sda1

Uncompress ``debian-mipsel-2007-Apr-17.tar.bz2`` in the ``/dev/sda1`` partition so that ``/bin``, ``/etc`` are at the top level.

Run ``mkswap`` on ``/dev/sda2``

Configure the network.

My home network (via ADSL modem) is 192.168.1.x so my ``/etc/network/interfaces`` is:

    auto lo
    iface lo inet loopback

    #auto eth0
    #iface eth0 inet dhcp

    auto eth0.100
    iface eth0.100 inet dhcp

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 192.168.1.66
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.1.1

    #auto eth0.100
    #iface eth0.100 inet static
    #address 192.168.1.25
    #netmask 255.255.255.0
    #network 192.168.1.128
    #broadcast 192.168.1.191
    #gateway 192.168.1.1

    # wireless doesn't work yet
    #auto eth1
    #iface eth1 inet static
    #   address 192.168.5.1
    #   netmask 255.255.255.0
    #   gateway 192.168.x.x
    #   wireless-essid networkname
    #   wireless-key 00000000000000000

My home router provides DNS so my ``/etc/resolv.conf`` looks like:

    nameserver 192.168.1.1

``/etc/hostname``:

    asusbox

Unmount the USB drive, plug it into the Asus.

For ethernet, I found that the LAN1 port worked (I thought that the WAN port would but it didn't). Connect the Asus to your main router via the LAN1 port as if it was a normal PC.

Power it up. It should respond to ping,and ssh. The default root password is toor, and it should be changed as soon as possible.

I have an old laptop hard drive attached to my WL-500gP using an IDE to USB cable:

Nice little silent PC:

It can handle rtorrent but uses a few Mb of swap and so it's not too quick to respond sometimes in an ssh terminal.
