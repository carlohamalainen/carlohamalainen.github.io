A while ago I read [a post](http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2009/08/pnas_alric_veterinary_patholog.php) about semi-alternative careers for scientists. One comment stood out:

This post is one of those interviews, giving the responses of Alric, a veterinary pathologist at a drug company)

The last paragraph is spot on. I wish more people thought in that way.
