I am pleased to announce the opening of [Playing Fair](http://playingfair.com.au/), my partner&#8217;s Brisbane-based online store for fair trade children&#8217;s clothes. All of the garments are sourced through an importer recognised by the British Association of Fair Trade Shops (BAFTS).

Here&#8217;s a small sample of the products that are available:</p>
