At the request of Budd I have pulled these files. Instead, pop over to <http://buddjawa.bandcamp.com> and <http://craigwestwood.bandcamp.com>. Cool!

In a similar style to [an earlier post](http://carlo-hamalainen.net/blog/?p=495), here is a FLAC rip of a classic Aussie metal CD:

[Christbait: Dirty Punk Mutha](http://carlo-hamalainen.net/music/Christbait/Dirty%20Punk%20Mutha/)

As usual, if you are the original artist and want these files taken down, let me know and I'll do so as soon as possible.

Enjoy! </s>
