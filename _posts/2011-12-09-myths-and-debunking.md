Quoting [Skeptical Science](http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-Part-3-Overkill-Backfire-Effect.html) on debunking myths:

> Common wisdom is that the more counter-arguments you provide, the more successful youâ€™ll be in debunking a myth. It turns out that the opposite can be true. When it comes to refuting misinformation, less can be more. Debunks that offered three arguments, for example, are more successful in reducing the influence of misinformation, compared to debunks that offered twelve arguments which ended up reinforcing the myth.
