Update 2013-01-06: [English instructions for the thermostat](https://s3.amazonaws.com/carlo-hamalainen.net/oldblog/stuff/BY-LOX_15A_instructions_english.jpg). 

I picked up a cheap thermostat [on eBay](http://myworld.ebay.com.au/aus_best_bargain/?_trksid=p4340.l2559) for controlling the temperature in my brewing fridge. The model number is [BY-LOX 15A](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=BY-LOX+15A). 

You can run the thermostat wire inside the door on the hinged side so there is no need to modify the fridge at all. I set the thermostat to 23C and the temperature sticker on the side of the tub stayed at about 24C throughout the brewing process. (By default it shows the current temp.)

The thermostat turns the fridge on when the temperature goes above the preset value. It doesn't get very cold at night in Brisbane so I haven't bothered with a dual control thermostat that can turn on a cooling and heating source.

Brewing at a constant 23-24C temperature has made a huge difference to the quality of my home brew. 

I usually get my home brew gear from [Annerley Home Brew](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=18386885248970706355&q=Annerley+Home+Brew,+428+Ipswich+Road,+Annerley,+Queensland,+Australia&hl=en&dtab=2&ie=UTF8&ll=-27.508463,153.03424&spn=0.007974,0.013937&t=m&z=17&vpsrc=0), a fantastic store on the south side of Brisbane.

The quality of your brew will improve even more by keeping your ales at 18\* and lagers at 10\*

I just bought the same model temp controller to turn my bar fridge into a cheese cave. I'm trying to maintain 10 degrees for aging my cheeses, but I'm having trouble as I've plugged it all in, set the temp but it is not cooling down to the 10 degrees. Do you need to set the temp while your fridge is below the desired temp to get the controller to work properly? Thanks.

Brooke: I tested out my fridge and thermostat this afternoon. At 4pm with the fridge off the thermostat said 27C. I then set it for 10C and by 8pm it had reached this temperature.

Have you set the fridge's own thermostat for maximum cooling?

My light is constant red and the unit seems to be working in reverse. If I set the temp below the ambient temp the fridge will not turn on. It only turns on when the controller is set higher than the ambient temp and therefore will never turn off.

Greg: what happens when you hold the up button? On my unit it flips between heating and cooling modes.

This May Help. Mine came with no English instructions 

Operating instructions: 

Switch on the thermostat with power. The screen shows current temperature. 

Button "SETTING": used for switch between "WORKING" mode and "SETTING" mode. Press once, the thermostat go into setting mode, press another, the thermostat goes back to working mode. 

Button "TEMPERATURE ": used for elevating temperature. When the screen shows "SETTING", each pressing on the button elevates 1 degree . Long pressing on increases the temperature till 38 degree. After 5 seconds no operating, the thermostat returns to working mode. 

Button "TEMPERATURE -": used for lowering temperature. When the screen shows "SETTING", each pressing on the button reduce 1degree . Long pressing on lowers the temperature till -9 degree. After 5 seconds no operating, the thermostat returns to working mode. 

Heating mode and cooling mode change: 

In the "WORKING" mode, press Button "TEMPERATURE ", after 4 seconds, the "WORK" mode will change, heating mode to cooling mode, or cooling mode to heating mode. Heating mode(red light bright): 

When current temperature ≤ set temperature -- 1degree ,switch on the power; 

When current temperature ≥ set temperature 1degree ,cut off the power; 

Cooling mode(green light bright): 

When current temperature ≥ set temperature 1degree ,switch on the power; 

When current temperature ≤ set temperature -- 1degree ,cut off the power; 

Protection function: 

When short circuit occurs, temperature screen shows [dd], the power automatically cut off.

Hi,

I have one of these ordered and should receive it tomorrow. They look good.

So, in a nutshell, if I want to hold my fridge temperature at 12 degrees C, do I carry out the following steps.

1) I set the fridge thermostat to as cold as possible.

2) I set this stat on WARM at 12 degrees,

3) then set it on COOL at 12 degrees.

is this correct, or will it never switch off? (Lol)

thanks

It only operates in cooling or warming mode, not both. So assuming the outside temperature is significantly above 20C, you'd set it to cooling mode (green light will come on) and 12C, fridge thermostat as cold as possible, and then it will turn the fridge on when the temperature hits 13C or so.

The comments here are super useful. I just got one of these for the brewing fridge and couldn't figure out how to get it to cool mode!

Thanks for the translation -- impossible to use the original instructions. Cheers. 

I am hoping to set mine up to keep an outdoor palm from freezing by switching on a set of Xmas lights, which are wrapped around the plant base, once the temp falls close to freezing.(+3degC). The string of lights total about 20W of power. So tree, then lights, then insulation fleece, then fingers crossed!! 

Many thanks all for your advice here.
