I recently discovered Kogge's book _The Architecture of Symbolic Computers_ via two blog posts: [Loper OS: The Book](http://www.loper-os.org/?p=13) and [fogus: Some Lisp books (and then some)](http://blog.fogus.me/2012/07/25/some-lisp-books-and-then-some/). The book seems to be out of print and second hand copies are quite expensive, so I decided to scan the table of contents and index so that people can get some idea of what the book contains before they drop ~$US90 on a copy: [Kogge\_The\_Architecture\_of\_Sybolic\_Computers\_TOC_INDEX.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/carlo-hamalainen.net/oldblog/stuff/Kogge_The_Architecture_of_Symbolic_Computers_TOC_INDEX.pdf). 

Part II (Function Based Computing) is the most interesting to me. Recently I have been experimenting with [Swift](http://www.ci.uchicago.edu/swift/main/) for structuring large scale computations. Swift uses the idea of a "future", and this is covered in Chapter 9 (Demand Driven Evaluation), along with lazy evaluation, streams, and continuations. 

**edit 2012-09-14:** I implemented an SECD interpreter in Python, using Chapter 7 of Kogge's book as a guide: <https://github.com/carlohamalainen/pysecd>.

$90? Wow... right now on Amazon, you'd have to part with almost $500 for a used copy.

$500 is obscene :-/

Whew! I managed to snag a copy in brilliant shape from Amazon a few months ago for ~$50.
