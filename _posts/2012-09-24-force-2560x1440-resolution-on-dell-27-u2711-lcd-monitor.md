I have a Dell Latitude E6530 with VGA and HDMI output and the NVIDIA NVS 5200M graphics card. The VGA output can&#8217;t manage the full 2560&#215;1440 resolution, and the HDMI output defaults to 1920&#215;1080 due to an incorrect EDID reported by the U2711 monitor. Using various sources, including this [post on Whirlpool](http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=1479962), I managed to construct an xorg.conf that forces the full 2560&#215;1440 resolution. If you use this on a desktop then you will probably have to change the ConnectedMonitor option, otherwise you&#8217;ll get a blank screen. 

A cleaner fix would be to edit the EDID file to have the correct resolution (basically copying the Modeline information below) but I had no luck with Phoenix EDID Designer 1.3.

Hi,  
Does this method work in windows platforms? Or only linux?

Thanks, it worked with my nvidia card and a Dell U2713HM on Lubuntu 12.04.  
I copy the Screen and Monitor sections, paste in the xorg.conf generated by the nvidia panel and now it shows the maximun resolution.

\# Tweaked values to get a 30Mhz refresh rate to work:  
That should read Hz not MHz.

I have the same problem with the maximum resolution. I need a better graphics card and a dual link DVI cable to solve this. But for the time being, this workaround (vertical refresh rate 30Hz) also works.

Theo: thanks, have changed Mhz to Hz.

Thank you so much! Got my DVI cables to finally run the native resolution and it wasn&#8217;t working! so I added several of the lines from your file and it worked!

The specific lines as part of the monitor sections for my displays were:  
Option &#8220;ModeDebug&#8221; &#8220;TRUE&#8221;  
Option &#8220;UseEdid&#8221; &#8220;FALSE&#8221;  
Option &#8220;ExactModeTimingsDVI&#8221; &#8220;True&#8221;

Modeline &#8220;2560&#215;1440&#8221; 148.78 2560 2696 2968 3376 1440 1441 1444 1469 -hsync +vsync  
Option &#8220;ModeValidation&#8221; &#8220;NoDFPNativeResolutionCheck&#8221;

Once again thank you so much ^_^

Thanks very much! I was struggling to get my new 27&#8243; Dell monitor working on Linux Mint 14. The output from cvt was wrong, or at least wouldn&#8217;t start the monitor up, but these settings are slightly different, and work first time ðŸ™‚

I was using the following  
ben@robot ~ $ cvt 2560 1440  
\# 2560&#215;1440 59.96 Hz (CVT 3.69M9) hsync: 89.52 kHz; pclk: 312.25 MHz  
Modeline &#8220;2560x1440_60.00&#8221; 312.25 2560 2752 3024 3488 1440 1443 1448 1493 -hsync +vsync

Found an even simpler solution: use a fully wired DVI cable ie one where middle pins are not missing!  
That way nvidia-config (317.19) picks everything up & the FX380 is able to drive full resolution ie 2560&#215;1440 (Dell U2711) without messing with xorg.conf.

An added wrinkle: for those using NVIDIA GTX5XX, eg GTX 560M, and connecting to a Samsung UD590, you&#8217;ll get hit with a double whammy. You&#8217;ll need to make the mentioned change above to your xorg.conf file (inserting the Modeline &#8220;2560&#215;1440&#8221; 148.78 2560 2696 2968 3376 1440 1441 1444 1469 -hsync +vsync line) to overcome the refresh limitation of HDMI. But you&#8217;ll also need to make the following change to overcome a bug in either the monitor firmware or Nvidia driver for checksums:

First look for

Section &#8220;Screen&#8221;

Thin in that section add the following line to overcome the checksum bug:

Option &#8220;ModeValidation&#8221; &#8220;AllowNon60hzmodesDFPModes, NoEDIDDFPMaxSizeCheck, NoVertRefreshCheck, NoHorizSyncCheck, NoDFPNativeResolutionCheck, NoMaxSizeCheck, NoMaxPClkCheck, AllowNonEdidModes, NoEdidMaxPClkCheck&#8221;

Of course, you&#8217;ll still limited to 2560&#215;1440 or whatever the capabilities are of your GTX 5xx card. But you won&#8217;t be stuck at 1920&#215;1080.
