At last month&#8217;s [BFPG](http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group/events/104664052/) meetup I did a talk on implementing a stack based machine and writing a simple Lisp compiler. I started the project some time last year, and it was good to give it a feeling of being finished by doing a talk about the process. I also spoke a bit about the book that I used for details on the SECD machine. All my code is on github as usual: <https://github.com/carlohamalainen/pysecd>. Slides are here: <https://s3.amazonaws.com/carlo-hamalainen.net/oldblog/stuff/bfpg-mini-lisp/>.

Video is here. Audio is a bit soft &#8211; first time at the new venue (Suncorp in Brisbane). Future recordings might have an audio feed from the lectern.

The guy who spoke before me, Sam Roberts, talked about his experiences of using Haskell and Mu at Standard Chartered Bank. Quite interesting. A colleague of his did a keynote which is up on Youtube:
