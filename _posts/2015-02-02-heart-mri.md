One perk of working at the [Centre for Advanced Imaging](http://cai.uq.edu.au/) is that I get to be a guinea pig on the new 7T MRI scanner. Here are some animations of my (live!) heart taken in late January 2015. I used [ITK-SNAP](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) to extract the images, with some quick and dirty contrast changes to the images.

Very interesting!

The images are cross-haired with letters on the ends of each cross line. What do the letters mean? I'm guessing L is left and R is right? What about the others?
