I&#8217;m sure that everyone has a Kafkaesque story from living in the Czech Republic. Here&#8217;s mine. 

In 2008 I wanted to attend the Prague Midsummer Combinatorial Workshop. The [webpage](/stuff/midsummer/work13.html) said that it was invite-only. No problem. I emailed the organisers and had two people reply saying that I could come along. Great! The page also said &#8220;There will be NO conference fee.&#8221; Even better! 

I turn up to register on the first day and I&#8217;m immediately asked for money. How strange. I ask one of the organisers why this is the case, given that the webpage said that there was no fee, and he said &#8220;I know the webpage says that but there is this fee.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t feel like paying for something that was meant to be free so I wrangled my way in to see the first talk. The opening speaker mentioned how great it was that this conference had no fees for the participants. I wasn&#8217;t impressed. 

By the next day the webpage had changed so that it [didn&#8217;t say anything about fees](/stuff/midsummer/work14.html). Nice.
