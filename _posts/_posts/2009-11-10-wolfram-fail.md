So Wolfram want people to produce free content for their demonstrations project. Fine. But sending spam where they misquote the title of [my paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5199) isn&#8217;t the best way to get things done. And if anyone is interested, the full Python source code is already available [here](http://bitbucket.org/carlohamalainen/dissections/). I used [SymPy](http://code.google.com/p/sympy/) for some symbolic manipulations. It&#8217;s all free and open source.

> The Demonstrations Project, launched alongside Mathematica 6 in May 2007, is a collection of over 5,000 interactive Demonstrations that cover myriad subjects, interests, and skill levels. The Demonstrations are free to download and manipulate thanks to Mathematica Player, which is also free, available at: <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/e/2/player" rel="nofollow">http://www.wolfram.com/e/2/player</a>

lol &#8220;caught the attention of one of my colleagues&#8221; &#8230; one of my colleagues who happens to be a data-mining algorithm that&#8217;s so poorly written it can&#8217;t even extract the title of an arxiv paper correctly!

&#8220;An enumeration of equilateral triangle&#8221;. I bet that was a riveting article:-

&#8212;  
Introduction: In this paper we enumerate an equilateral triangle.

Results: There&#8217;s only one of them!

Conclusion: There is one equilateral triangle.  
&#8212;

Dr Carlo, will your group be applying your novel technique to other related open problems, like enumerating equilateral rectangles or maybe even pentagons? Perhaps you should submit the algorithm to the Wolfram Demonstrations Project:-

&#8212;  
def main():  
print &#8216;1&#8217;  
if \_\_name\_\_ == &#8220;\_\_main\_\_&#8221;:  
main()  
&#8212;
