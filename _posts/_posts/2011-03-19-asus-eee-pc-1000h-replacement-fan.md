I use an Asus EEE PC 1000H as a home file server. After being on 24/7 for a while the fan started getting noisy, so I ordered a replacement from [91deals](http://myworld.ebay.com/91deals/) on eBay. The fan was listed as &#8220;Asus Eee PC 1000 1000HA 1000HE CPU Fan BSB04505HA&#8221;.

Opening up the 1000H was a bit tricky due to some hidden clips, but [this guide for the 1000HA](http://eeepc1005.blogspot.com/2009/09/upgrade-time.html) had all the details.

Hi, I have an asus eee 1000h as well, bought in the UK, do you know if there is any way to check exactely what fan I have withouth taking my netbook apart? I only have this netbook, the fan is getting noisy, and on ebay it seems to have about 4 different types listed for the 1000h. Any ideas? Thanks!

When I ordered my fan back in 2011 I only found one option for the 1000H on ebay.com.au, so I went with that.

I guess try some forums, or take a punt with a randomly chosen fan on eBay. At least they aren&#8217;t too expensive (around 5GBP?).
