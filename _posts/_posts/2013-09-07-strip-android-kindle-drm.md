I bought an ebook from Amazon using their Android Kindle app. Unfortunately the Android app is crippleware in that you can&#8217;t export your highlights and notes. So I looked into how to strip the DRM so that I could read the ebook on my Linux (Debian) laptop using a non-DRM-encumbered application. Also, [past behaviour](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/technology/companies/18amazon.html?_r=0) of Amazon doesn&#8217;t inspire confidence. 

I tried using [Apprentice Alf&#8217;s tools](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/) with Calibre on Debian but the decryption didn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m not 100% sure but it seemed to be missing the PID of the ebook (the PRC file on my Android device). Some people have written [patches for the Android Kindle app](https://github.com/psyrendust/dedrm-ebook-tools/tree/master/Other_Tools/Kindle_for_Android_Patches) so that you can view the ebook&#8217;s PID, but they are not up to date. And frankly, patching an apk is a fairly involved process. 

The work-around is to run Calibre and Apprentice Alf&#8217;s tools on Windows. Here are the details: 

1. Install [Calibre on Windows](http://calibre-ebook.com/download_windows). 

2. Install the [Kindle PC application](http://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/pc/download) from Amazon. 

3. Install [Apprentice Alf&#8217;s tools](http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/) in Calibre. You want to point Calibre at the  
file DeDRM\_calibre\_plugin/DeDRM\_plugin.zip which is inside tools\_v6.0.8.zip (don&#8217;t unzip DeDRM_plugin.zip!).  
Local mirror: <https://s3.amazonaws.com/carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/alfs_tools/>. 

4. Buy an ebook using the Android app (or any linked device). 

5. In Kindle PC, sync the book. 

6. In Calibre, import the book. You&#8217;ll find it in My DocumentsMy Kindle Content. When you import the book in Calibre, Alf&#8217;s plugin will automatically strip the DRM. 

7. The file in My DocumentsCalibre can now be copied to another device, for example imported into Calibre on a Linux/Debian system. 

Here are some screenshots for steps 3, 6, and 7: <http://www.sanspantalones.com/2013/05/30/how-to-remove-drm-from-your-kindle-books/>.

Overall, this is a huge pain. At least with my music purchases I can support artists on a site that does not use DRM: [bandcamp.com](http://bandcamp.com/).

Sadly this doesn&#8217;t work for many eMags, the Kindle PC App won&#8217;t download them

Ebook providers try to lock you in to their services; that&#8217;s their business model, and it&#8217;s how they make their money. But it&#8217;s extremely frustrating for the end-user. You end up financially committed to a provider because you&#8217;ve purchased many books from them. It happened to me with Google Books. Someone else could have come along with a much better Ebook provider, but I&#8217;d still feel like I was shackled to Google Books because I already &#8216;own&#8217; significant content there.

The problem is then exascerbated when you find that a book you wanted isn&#8217;t available from your regular service provider, but it&#8217;s available at one of the others. So then you become locked in to \*two\* Ebook service providers! And you have to download their apps in order to read the books, which means you can&#8217;t always access the content on portable devices when you need it, and etc etc etc. The whole situation is a real pain in the back side. 

I recently decided enough was enough. I now host my Ebooks myself! I still purchase them legitimately from Ebook service providers, but I strip the DRM using the methods highlighted in this article, then I manage the book in Calibre and host my Calibre library on my own server, thereby freeing me from the frustration of online Ebook service providers.
