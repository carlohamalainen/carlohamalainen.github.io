title: Using 'yield' to simulate a Markov chain
---

One thing that I really like about Sage is that it uses Python as its underlying language. This means that we get "for free" many nice features of Python. One of these features that I particularly like is the ``yield`` keyword. Here is a small example:

```python
def foo():
    i = 0
    while True:
        yield i
        i = i + 1
```

We can use the ``foo`` function as a _generator_:

    sage: g = foo()
    sage: print g.next()
    0
    sage: print g.next()
    1
    sage: print g.next()
    2

In other words, the ``yield`` keyword acts as a way to a Python function into a generator. The execution of ``foo`` is paused until the next call to ``g.next()``. If we reach the end of the function, the ``StopIteration`` exception is raised.

The ``yield`` keyword makes it pretty easy to write the skeleton for a Markov chain simulator, using the following basic form:

```python
def markov_chain():
    state = initial_state()
    while True:
        yield state

        state = new_state(state)

        if some_condition: return
```

For a real example, see [sage.combinat.matrices.latin.LatinSquare_generator](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/combinat/sage/combinat/matrices/latin.html#sage.combinat.matrices.latin.LatinSquare_generator). The Markov chain itself was given by Jacobson and Matthews in "Generating uniformly distributed random Latin squares," Journal of Combinatorial Designs, vol 4, 1996, no 6, pp 405--437.
