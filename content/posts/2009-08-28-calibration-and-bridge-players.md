After reading [Why we make mistakes](http://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Make-Mistakes-Without/dp/0767928059) I wanted to read more about the calibration of bridge players. The research article is not available without a subscription, so here's a PDF: 

[Gideon Keren: Facing uncertainty in the game of bridge: A calibration study (1987)](/stuff/Keren%20-%20Facing%20uncertainty%20in%20the%20game%20of%20bridge:%20a%20calibration%20study%20%281987%29.pdf).
