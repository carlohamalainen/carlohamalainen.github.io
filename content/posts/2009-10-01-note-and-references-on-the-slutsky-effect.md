To quote Barnett (2006), the Slutsky effect, as understood by most economists, is the following:

> If the variables that were taken to represent business cycles were moving averages of past determining quantities that were not serially correlated – either real-world moving averages or artificially generated moving averages – then the variables of interest would become serially correlated, and this process would produce a periodicity approaching that of sine waves.

I wrote a short note using [SageTeX](http://bitbucket.org/ddrake/sagetex/) demonstrating the effect, closely following [Royoma's book](http://www.amazon.com/Analytical-Population-Dynamics-Community-Biology/dp/0412243202).

Two useful papers (click for PDF):
