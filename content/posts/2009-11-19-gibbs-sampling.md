Here's a short note on Gibbs sampling, explaining a simple case with two random variables: [gibbs.pdf](/stuff/gibbs/gibbs.pdf). Source code: [gibbs_2x2.py](/stuff/gibbs/gibbs_2x2.py) (run this file using [Sage](http://sagemath.org)). You can browse all the related files [here](/stuff/gibbs/).

My note and source code follows the 2x2 example in this paper (click for a local copy):
[Casella, George; George, Edward I. (1992). "Explaining the Gibbs sampler". The American Statistician 46 (3): 167â€“174](/stuff/gibbs/Casella_George_Explaining_the_Gibbs_Sampler_1992.pdf).
