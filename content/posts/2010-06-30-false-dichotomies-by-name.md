Knuth wrote somewhere that he decided to call his code/LaTeX markup system _literate programming_ because it implied that everyone else was doing illiterate programming, and no one wants to be illiterate. I'm sure that someone else has already made a list, but here goes anyway:

 **Attachment parenting**. Better than chaining your toddler to a wall in your basement.

 **Literate programming**. Anyone for some illiterate programming?

 **Natural parenting**. Red food colouring makes kids happy, right?

 **Structured programming**. Let's use goto statements everywhere!

Anyone know some more examples?
