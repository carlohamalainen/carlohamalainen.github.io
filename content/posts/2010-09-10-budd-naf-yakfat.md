At the request of Budd I have pulled these files. Instead, pop over to <http://buddjawa.bandcamp.com> and <http://craigwestwood.bandcamp.com>. Cool! 

<s>

Inspired by [this post at sister-hell](http://sister-hell.blogspot.com/2008/09/budd-yakfat-1993_11.html), I decided to upload two Budd CDs. I ripped from my original CDs to FLAC, a lossless format, which is [well supported on Unix, Windows, OSX, etc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Lossless_Audio_Codec#Decoding). Enjoy!

[Budd -- Naf](/music/Budd/Naf/)

[Budd -- Yakfat](/music/Budd/Yakfat/)

(If you are the original artist and want these files taken down, let me know and I'll do so as soon as possible.) </s>
