If you could put a video clip to the book [Crabgrass frontier: the suburbanization of the United States](http://books.google.com/books/about/Crabgrass_frontier.html?id=lwave_qPlYUC), it would have to be Regurgitator's Superstraight:

Lyrics:

> gimme love gimme good good times
> here in suburbia the best you can buy
> this is my home i keep my family inside
> i'm late for work now honey i got to fly
> he's superstraight yeah he's superstraight
> i push my big sedan through the traffic jam
> like salmon spawning to get into a can
> i sing along to the pop radio
> it's propaganda but i know how it goes
> you know i work all day and im out of my mind
> i go man, im only human man i gotta unwind
> i love my baby yeah shes number one
> work girl means nothin i just bang her for fun
> and when the weekend comes it's time for my drugs
> i suck em down count it two by one
> help me remember to forget who i am
> and when it's over babe
> that's when it starts up again
