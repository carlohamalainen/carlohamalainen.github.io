I went to the [Bicycle Queensland / Scody Ride to Work](http://bikeweek.bq.org.au/whats-on/events/scody-ride-to-work-day/) event in King George Square earlier this month.

It was drizzling but I didn't mind...

Heaps of people turned up. My mate Tony won a bike light in the raffle. I was pleased with the free (healthy!) breakfast.

Naturally there were some interesting bikes around. One guy had a compass on his handlebars:

Must be fun to ride in a headwind. Or side-wind.

I won the tshirt for Tokyo to Osaka ðŸ™‚
