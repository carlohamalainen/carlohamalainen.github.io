My Boardman Team TXC 650b hardtail mountain bike has an FSA crankset and bottom bracket. After a year and a half the bottom bracket got quite rough so I decided to swap it out with a Hope Hollowtech II bottom bracket.

I couldn't find much online about this bottom bracket. Markings include: "FSA B3164 MegaExo 24mm MS185" and "BC1.37" x 24T".

I replaced it with [this Hope bottom bracket](https://web.archive.org/web/20171122105839/http://www.chainreactioncycles.com/sg/en/hope-mtb-stainless-steel-bottom-bracket/rp-prod80494), the 68/73mm model:

It comes with three spacers but not all are needed.

The drive side cup of the new bottom bracket screwed in easily but I stripped the thread of the bottom bracket on the non-drive side, probably due to gunk in the threads.

I managed to get the cup out and then used a dremel (on low speed) to clean up the threads.

To chase the threads, I made a few cuts into the new bottom bracket cup (following [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1IrAGP22V34)), which let me push into the bottom bracket enough to bite into the thread.

If you get this wrong you can destroy the thread in the frame, so take care.
