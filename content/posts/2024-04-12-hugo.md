title: Jekyll to Hugo blog migration

I migrated my blog from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io),
mainly because I have no experience with Ruby and don't have the time to stay up
to date with another language and framework.

I did most of the migration in a [mega-commit](https://github.com/carlohamalainen/carlohamalainen.github.io/commit/4096a71a1370171824dda513f57c94899e18cbbc).

I went with the [Hugo-Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) theme, only making one minor tweak for the
[width of content](https://github.com/carlohamalainen/carlohamalainen.github.io/blob/master/assets/scss/_base.scss#L260):

```css
 .container {
   margin: 1rem auto;

   max-width: 120rem; /* max-width: 90rem; */
 }
```

I only had one issue with LaTeX equations, which I reported in this issue: [Single equal symbol is parsed as a Markdown header inside a $$ block. #17](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo-goldmark-extensions/issues/17).

The maths block

    $$
    P
    =
    Q
    $$

unexpectedly renders to

    <h1>$$
    P</h1>
    <p>Q
    $$</p>

because the ``P`` is interpreted as a header due to the equals sign on the following line. This seems
to be a quirk of the Goldmark parser, which runs "block" parsers first.

One workaround is to indent the ``=`` by four spaces:

    $$
    P
        =
    Q
    $$

which renders as:

$$
P
    =
Q
$$

Another option is to use empty braces ``{}`` which are like a no-op in LaTeX:

    $$
    P
    {}=
    Q
    $$

This renders as expected:

$$
P
{}=
Q
$$

Yet another option is to use an ``align*`` environment:

    $$
    \begin{align*}
    P
    &=
    Q
    \end{align*}
    $$

which renders as:

$$
\begin{align*}
P
&=
Q
\end{align*}
$$

This is all about avoiding the ``=`` being interpreted as a Markdown header block.

In my case, $P$ and $Q$ were large matrices in the post [Knight on a chess board](/2019/03/06/knight-on-a-chess-board/).

For anyone that comes across this, I'm [using KaTeX](https://github.com/carlohamalainen/carlohamalainen.github.io/blob/master/config.toml#L15-L17)

```toml
[params]
katex = true
math = true
```
