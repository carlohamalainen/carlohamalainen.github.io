<h3> First announcement </h3>
<p>

The workshop continues the tradition of 
<a href="http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/workshops/index.html">Prague Combinatorial Workshops</a>
held since 1993. Oriented on problems of all fields of graph theory,  
combinatorics and discrete geometry, it will  continue in  the  spirit and  
informal  working  atmosphere of the previous meetings. 

The workshop takes place at 
<a href="http://dimatia.mff.cuni.cz/">DIMATIA</a> and  the  
<a href="http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/">Department of Applied Mathematics</a> of 
<a href="http://www.cuni.cz/">Charles University</a>
which is located in a historic building in the center of Old 
Prague. For the seventh time the workshop is also supported by 
<a href="http://iti.mff.cuni.cz/">ITI</a> Charles University
(Center for Theoretical Computer Science). 
A booklet of problems  communicated at the workshop will be published in 
the Department <a href="http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/%7Ekamserie/">KAM-DIMATIA Series</a>.
